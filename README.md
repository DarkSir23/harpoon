**---Harpoon.....-->**
version - 0.75

**Description**
---------
This is a python-cli based application that can either be run from the cli directly, or as a daemon to automatically send and/or monitor torrents to a remote torrent client and monitor for completion and retrieve the completed files back to the local machine where automatic post-processing against specific clients can be initiated.

**Requirements**
----------
- LINUX only
- Python 2.7.9+ (for SNI support)
- lftp
- rutorrent client (running remotely - ie.seedbox)
- sonarr        (optional)
- radarr        (optional)
- lidarr        (optional)
- mylar         (optional)
- lazylibrarian (optional)
- sickrage      (optional)
- plex          (optional)


**Options via command line**
-----------------------
``-h, --help``                      Show this help message and exit

``-a filename, --add=filename``     Specify a filename to snatch from specified torrent client when daemon monitor is running already.

``-s HASH, --hash=HASH``            Specify a HASH to snatch from specified torrent client.

``-l LABEL, --label=LABEL``         For use ONLY with -t, specify a label that the HASH has that harpoon can check against when querying the torrent client.

``-t, --exists``                    In combination with -s (Specify a HASH) & -l (Specify a label) with this enabled it will not download the torrent (it must exist in the designated location already) but perform post-processing
  
``-f FILE, --file=FILE``            Specify an exact filename to snatch from specified torrent client. (Will do recursive if more than one file)

``-b, --partial``                   Grab the torrent regardless of completion status (for cherrypicked torrents since they'll never be 100% complete)

``-m, --monitor``                   Monitor a designated file location for new files to harpoon.

``-d, --daemon``                    Daemonize the complete program so it runs in the background.

``-p PIDFILE, --pidfile=PIDFILE``   Specify a pidfile location to store pidfile for daemon usage.

**[multiple seedboxes and the conf file]**

If there is a 2nd seedbox to monitor (multiple_seedboxes = True), copy the entire rtorrent section again and label the second section ``[rtorrent2]`` with the changed information therein.

Same applies to post-processing, copy so that an additional section called ``[post-processing2]`` is setup, and modify 2 fields so that they are ``PP_HOST2`` and ``PP_SSHPORT2`` therein instead of the default ones.


**Usage (Daemon mode)**
----------
Harpoon can monitor a given directory (ie. watch directory) for actual .torrent files. Once the torrent files are recognized they are sent to the remote torrent client for monitoring and automatic retrieval back to the local client upon completion.

For organizational/operational usage it is best to create a folder for .torrent files to be monitored and then subfolders for each label that is required. Post-processing can then be accomplished using these labels as the requirement to call the given post-processing application via direct api calls (ie. tv = sonarr, movies = radarr, comics = mylar, etc).

**For Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr**
----------

**NOTE FOR SONARR > V2.0.0.5301** Remote Mapping MUST be enabled - your remote mapping folder is the location where sonarr puts your tv-related torrents on your seedobox, local is where harpoon drops them prior to post-processing

In any of the above applications, go to Settings / Connections and create a custom script. Give the name something obvious 'HARPOON', and set the On Grab option to Yes, and the On Download option to No.  Set the Path option to the location of your python executable (ie. /usr/bin/python), and then in the arguments set it to the complete path to the harpoonshot.py file which is currently located in the root of the harpoon folder with the application name at the end of the argument line (ie. /opt/harpoon/harpoonshot.py radarr OR /opt/harpoon/harpoonshot.py sonarr).

Save the script and make sure it's enabled. That's it - now whenever sonarr/radarr/lidarr snatch a torrent it will still send it directly to the given client, but it will also run the harpoonshot.py script right after which contains information that allows harpoon to monitor the file by hash on the torrent client. It will create a file in the given watch directory folder, under the specific label, as the hash of the file with the extension of either .radarr.hash, .sonarr.hash, or lidarr.hash once it's been successfully added to the watch queue (once post-processing has been successfully completed, these files in the watch directory are automatically removed).

**For Mylar**
---------
In Configuration: 

- Quality & Post-Processing tab, Post-Processing section, *Run script AFTER an item has been snatched and sent to client* is enabled. Enter full path location to harpoonshot.py in the On Snatch Script Location field.

- Web Interface tab, API, *Enable API* (if not already enabled). *Generate* Mylar API Key if one doesn't exist already.

- Save configuration and restart Mylar so ApiKey will be valid.

- Set values in harpoon.conf for Mylar usage as indicated above.


**For LazyLibrarian**
----------

Go to Config, Notifications, *Enable Custom Notifications*.  Select *Notify on Snatch*, and enter the full path to harpoonshot.py.  Save the configuration.  You may test the script, if you like.   Whenever lazylibrarian snatches a torrent, it will run harpoonshot.py, and allow harpoon to monitor the file on the torrent client.
